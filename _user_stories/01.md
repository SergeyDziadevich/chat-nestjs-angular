need:

* Angular
* Nestjs
* npm
* docker

Story: As a developer I want the NestJS Backend and the Angular Frontend to be set up. 
Both should be run with a dockerfile. They should be run/started together via a docker-compose file,
so we can start everything with one command. The NestJS Backend should connect to a Postgres database, 
that is also started with docker-compose file. At the end of this story the Frontend should be able to retrieve 
a value from the Backend, all inside docker.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Set Up Angular (/)
2. Set Up NestJS (/)
3. Start Angular with Docker-Compose/Dockerfile & access in the browser via http://localhost:4200 (/)
4. Start NestJS with Docker-Compose/Dockerfile & get a basic value via http://localhost:3000/api (/)
5. NestJS should connect to a postgres database with docker-compose (/)
6. Angular should display a value that it gets from the NestJS Backend (/)
